# Project Documentation for Weather Data Collection

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step process for setting up, developing, and deploying the Weather Data Collection project. The project involves collecting weather data using the Weatherstack API and uploading it to Azure Blob Storage.

## Objectives
- Fetch real-time weather data using Weatherstack API.
- Store the retrieved data in Azure Blob Storage for further analysis and processing.

## Prerequisites
- An active Azure subscription.
- A GitHub account for version control.
- Python development environment with necessary packages installed.

## Project Setup

### Initial Setup
1. **Create Azure Resources**:
   - Set up an Azure Blob Storage account to store the collected weather data.
   - Configure Blob Containers to organize the data storage.

2. **API Subscription**:
   - Register for the Weatherstack API to obtain an API key necessary for fetching weather data.

### Development Environment
- Set up a Python environment.
- Install required libraries such as `requests` for API calls and `azure-storage-blob` for interacting with Blob Storage.

## Development Process

### Script Creation
- Develop a Python script to:
  - Call the Weatherstack API.
  - Handle the response and format the data.
  - Connect to Azure Blob Storage and upload the data.

### Error Handling and Logging
- Implement comprehensive error handling to catch and log errors during API interaction or data upload.
- Use Python's logging module to create a log file that records operations, successes, and failures.

## Testing
- Conduct unit tests to ensure the script functions correctly under different scenarios.
- Perform integration testing to verify that the script interacts correctly with external services (API and Azure Blob Storage).

## Deployment

### Local Environment
- Run the script manually in a local environment to ensure it operates as expected.
- Set up a schedule to run the script at regular intervals using a task scheduler.

### Cloud Deployment (Optional)
- Deploy the script to a cloud platform like Azure Functions for automated execution based on triggers or schedules.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Set Up Monitoring Tools
- Configure Azure Monitor to track the performance and health of the Blob Storage.
- Set alerts for high usage or error conditions.

### Regular Updates
- Update the script as needed to accommodate changes in the API or storage requirements.
- Regularly review and update the dependencies to maintain security and efficiency.

## Conclusion
- Summarize the project's success and any potential next steps or enhancements that could be made.

## Appendix
- Include any additional notes, alternative configurations, or reference materials that are relevant to the project.
